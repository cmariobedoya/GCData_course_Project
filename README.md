# GCData_course_Project
# This code does the following.
# STEP 1:Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
# STEP 2:Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
# STEP 3:Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
# STEP 4:Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
# STEP 5:From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
